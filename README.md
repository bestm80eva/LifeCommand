A simple decision making game developed on PASCAL.

My teacher kept asking for more complicated functions as the lessons kept going.
It first started out asking for name input and making the "map", and went on making an inventory, an HUD etc.

This is not the final product. It's something i started and keep updating when have free time. It's a development that can go forever.

suggestions are welcomed and appreciated.
